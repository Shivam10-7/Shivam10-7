## 🌟 About Me

I’m a budding coder who’s just starting to unravel the mysteries of programming. I study IT at Government Polytechnic Nagpur, where I’m learning the ropes of coding, debugging, and not breaking my laptop (fingers crossed). I love the challenge of solving problems and the thrill of seeing my code actually work. Outside of coding, I’m into video games, tech reading, and dreaming of becoming a coding wizard someday!

## 📚 What I'm Learning

I’m currently exploring these languages and technologies, building a solid foundation step by step:

- **HTML & CSS**: Crafting the web, one tag and style at a time. Excited to build my first portfolio site soon!
- **C & C++**: Grasping the fundamentals. Pointers are still my nemesis, but I’m getting there.
- **Python**: Loving its versatility and eager to dive deeper.
- **SQL**: Just starting to query databases—tables are my new friends.

My focus is on mastering the basics while exploring what excites me most: web development and problem-solving.

## 🚀 My Coding Journey

Here are some milestones I’ve hit so far (and a few stumbles I’ve survived):

- **First "Hello World"**: Felt like I’d unlocked a superpower.
- **First Bug Fix**: Hours of debugging paid off—victory tasted sweet!
- **First Web Page**: Made a simple page with HTML/CSS that didn’t look half bad.
- **Current Struggle**: Wrangling pointers in C. If you’ve got tips, I’m all ears!

Every win, big or small, keeps me motivated. It’s all about progress, not perfection.

## 💻 Current Projects

Here’s what I’m tinkering with right now:

- **C Calculator**: A simple program to practice arithmetic operations.
- **Portfolio Website**: Building a personal site with HTML and CSS to showcase my work.
- **Python Basics**: Experimenting with loops and conditionals to get comfortable.

These mini-projects are helping me apply what I’m learning and boost my confidence.
